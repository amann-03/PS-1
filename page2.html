<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"> HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</blockquote>
<p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

<pre>
This line will be printed after a line break from above paragraph because of <!--<br>--> tag. Also since this is written inside the <!--<pre>--> tag, it will follow all the spaces i.e indentations and line breaks as written directly in the paragraph.
Let's write a <b>soothing</b> poem in italics with the help of <!--<i>--> tag.
<i style="color: black;">
	Take <em>courage</em>, man,
	be brave and 
	drive ahead,
	<strong>Start</start> where you stand.
